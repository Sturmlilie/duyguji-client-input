# Duyguji

The fabric mod for all your emoji needs 😂👌💯💦

# Usage

When entering text, type ":" plus one of the available shortcodes (for example, `:envelope:`) to start seeing suggestions. Press **UP** or **DOWN** to select a shortcode or continue typing until only one suggestion is left. To apply the shortcode, press **TAB** (not enter!). All available shortcodes can be found and edited in `.minecraft/config/duyguji/vanilla.txt`. It is generated on first launch (or whenever it is deleted) from [this default file](src/main/resources/assets/duyguji/vanilla.txt). Feel free to add your own definitions.

This mod is **client-side** only and by default contains shortcodes for symbols all vanilla clients can render, so your friends don't have to install it to see the ❤s you'll hopefully send them!

Shortcode input currently works in:
* Chat
* Anvil name field

Please note that this is a **very early** development version, support is planned for all popular messenger emotes (like the ones at the top) as well as per-server custom emotes.
